so how does any of this work?
great question

right now i am typing in neovim in a tmux session in my terminal

i am going to build my blog from scratch right now

dont worry i have alot of shortcuts

is this a comment?
if so, h1 is site technomad, h2 is page blog, h3 is article how all of this works, h4 is impt

##### where to start

the first thing i need to do is clone my tms
this time i wanted to try to include it as a submodule?
i think that will help with splitting the content
but then im going to need to reconfig the whole stack
sweeeeet

##### some first moves

mkdir tm-blog
add this file in there

- probably gonna add the whole rd, search for some yaml
